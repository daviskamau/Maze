# DFS-Maze-Solving
Implementation of DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm in Python language to solve a maze in various sizes, starting and ending location.
 ### Step 1
 Install the required library by  
`pip install pyamaze`  
or  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
### Step 2
Change configurations in the maze_config.txt file based on your preferences.  
### Step 3
Change the path to the maze_config.txt file in the *DFS_Algorithm.py file* at line 6.  
### Step 4
Run the script and see how the DFS algorithm travel to find the paths by  
`python3 DFS_Algorithm.py`
